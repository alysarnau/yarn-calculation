            <h3>Has this happened to you?</h3>
            <p>You have a half-used bundle of yarn in your stash. It's lovely: great color, perfect drape. But there's only one problem...</p>
            <p><em><strong>How many yards are left???</strong></em></p>
            <p>You know the type of yarn. You know how many yards/meters it had initially, and how many grams/ounces it was. Sure, you can do some quick back of the envelope math and work it out...</p>
            <h3>Why do that when you have this site?</h3>
            <p>Simply put in the original weight and length and let our calculator handle the rest!</p>
